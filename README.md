# PBSphere
A little PBS algorithm made with radium engine.
The executable version of this programm is just a little demo of my PBS implementation.

## Notes

- [Radium engine] and all his dependencies are required (you can get all the details directly on their github page).

- The compilation can easily be done by using the cmake file, just do not forget to add the path to radium-engine (with ```-DRadium_DIR="path to radium engine"```).

- If the code does not work properly, it is probably because i'm testing things on it ;)
